# VolumeControlArduino
## The original source code can be found in the description of this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGvRyECE2mE
* An Arduino file acompanied with a C# file use serial port communication to create a external analog volume control. The original code was intended for a potentiometer. This implementation is intended for an analog joystick. 
* The Components include:
1. Arduino Uno (or any microcontroller substitute)
2. Analog Joystick
3. Computer Running Windows
4. LED Lights 
# Future Implementations
1. Custom Macros using external buttons
2. GUI 
3. LCD to show computer volume and microphone input level. 
# Notes
* In the future, wiring diagrams and .STL files will be provided, so others can replicate the project. I also intend on providing photos of the finished product when smaller microcontrollers arrive.
